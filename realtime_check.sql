-- Which tables THIS project subscribes to, and whether realtime is on.
--
-- A subscription to a table that is not in the supabase_realtime publication
-- does not error — it connects, waits, and never fires. The "live" feature
-- built on it silently becomes a refresh-only one. ICT-Lab had five such
-- tables (tasks, task_comments, re_messages, support_messages,
-- admin_notifications) and nobody had noticed.
--
-- Regenerate after adding a subscription:
--   grep -rhoE "table: '[a-z_]+'" src | sed "s/table: '//;s/'//" | sort -u
